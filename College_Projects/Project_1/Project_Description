Data warehouse project:
Description: Work on NFL Quarterback statistics gathered during a game. Calculate the rating for each quarterback to determine how well a quarterback or passer is performing
             The NFL rates its passers for statistical purposes against a fixed performance standard based on statistical achievements of all qualified pro passers since 1960
             The current system replaced one that rated passers in relation to their position in a total group based on various criteria.
             Working with the Extraction and Transportation utilities included with Oracle
             Environment: SQL*Loader, Data Pump, transportable tablespaces, PL/SQL functions, sequences, multitable inserts and external tables

Step 1: Using SQL*Loader to load data to a staging table
        Steps:
        A flat file that is based on the current 2014 NFL Quarterbacks is given
        Create a table to store the data 
        Find out figure what data types are required for the various fields
        Convert to a csv file to be uploaded to the database
        Load the file containing quarterback statistics; file contains header, create a SQL Loader control file to get it done
        
Step 2: Loading data into a regular table	
        Steps:
        Create a second table to store the records (treat this table as a staging table load to the main table) that will also contain a numeric value that can be the 
        surrogate primary key for the table, define a sequence in Oracle to provide the surrogate primary key value for each record you insert into the table
        This table should have separate columns for the quarterback’s first name and the quarterback’s last name in addition to a separate column for the player’s position
        (Building three columns out of one)
        Perform a calculation to determine the Completion Percentage
        
Step 3: Loading data into an External Table
        Steps:
        Second file which contains a list of the teams that are in the NFL (National Football League) is to be stored in an external table
        
Step 4: Calculate the QB Rating
        Steps:
        Create a PL/SQL user defined function to perform the calculation for the quarterback rating
        This function is to be added to the above instructions to perform this calculation as the data is being loaded
        Four categories are used as a basis for compiling a rating:
          •	Percentage of completions per attempt
          •	Percentage of touchdown passes per attempt
          •	Percentage of interceptions per attempt
          •	Yards per Attempt
        To make the rating more understandable, the point rating is then converted into a scale of 100. In rare cases, where statistical performance has been superior, 
        it is possible for a passer to surpass a 100 rating. 
        For example, take Steve Young's record-setting season in 1994 when he completed 324 of 461 passes for 3,969 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.
        The four calculations would be:
          •	Completions per Attempt — (((Completions / Attempts) * 100) - 30) / 20. (call this A).
          •	Touchdowns Per Attempt — ((TDs / Attempts) * 100) / 5  ( call this B)
          •	Interceptions per Attempt – (9.5 – ((Interceptions / Attempts)) / 4 (call this C)
          •	Yards per Attempt – ((Yards / Attempts) – 3 / 4 (call this D)
        The rating is calculated by taking the values of A, B, C and D, adding these together and dividing. .06
        (A + B + C + D+) / .06
        The values of A,B, C, and D cannot be greater than 2.375 or less than 0.  If the values are outside these bounds, set the value to 2.375 for the upper limit and to 0 
        for the lower limit.
        Furthermore, A, B, C, or D cannot be less than zero or larger than 2.375. Raise or lower the component to meet the limit.

Step 5: Loading data from Transportable Tablespace
        Steps:
        Create a tablespace to hold the data from your table using CTAS
        Use NFLQBs2014 data and move any records where the qb rating is greater than 70.0 to the new table you have just created
        Use the expdp to export this data to a dump file
        Move the data and the dump file to another directory on your drive
        Verify that the data is successfully copied
        Use the impdp to make the tablespace accessible to your database
        
Step 6: Multitable Insert
        Steps:
        Create three tables
          •	To hold the quarterbacks who have a rating above 85
          •	To store the quarterbacks who have a rating less than 85 but greater than 60
          •	To store the quarterbacks who have a rating below 60
          
Step 7: Create a New Table where the data is ordered by the QB passer rating
        Steps:
        Create a new table to store the data in order by yards placed 
        Use a sequence to show a ranking number starting at 1 for each row in this table
