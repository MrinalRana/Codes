    <p id="slide"><strong>Tinder</strong> is a highly skilled team with an eye for details. We got exactly what we wanted and more. The website designing and communication works really well through the online project tools and the dedicated project manager made a great job keeping things together. We are looking forward to the next collaboration!</p>

    <p>Working with the <strong>Tinder</strong> team was a pleasant experience. Two things in particular about their service is exceptional: their speed of response to emails, they were always available to answer my questions and provide feedback as the project went along. Secondly they demonstrated a clear understanding of the scope and nature of the project and delivered accordingly.</p>

    <p>With myself having no experience in website design and being particularly technical, the guys at <strong>Tinder</strong> were a great help, particularly Mark who went to great detail and length to help get the new website up and running, and did so in a very friendly manner. Excellent customer service. Excellent Product. Would Definitely Recommend.</p>

    <p>Having sub-contracted work to <strong>Tinder</strong> several times I have always found them to be extremely professional. In addition they are punctual and always willing to go the extra mile. Looking forward to working with them again in the future.

    <p><strong>Tinder</strong> has helped us the best with redesigning our website. They not only reduced its loading time by implementing the right technology but also ensured that it is attractive and easy-to-use. They developed custom modules by understanding our needs effectively, ensured seamless communication for managing exigencies and delivered regular updates. Highly recommend them if you are looking for great output.</p>

    <p><strong>Tinder</strong> - one of the great web development companies in North America I have ever worked with. My HTML based website developed exactly as what I wanted. With an eye for detail & a great understanding of HTML, <strong>Tinder</strong> helped me to open up lots more possibilities of HTML for my project. Great project management with the delivery of desired result. Highly recommend this company for HTML web development!</p>

    <p>I assigned <strong>Tinder</strong> to a redesigning job of my existing site. They left no loophole exposed in their redesigning work and created a fresh, eye-tempting design for my site. Really, the new design is very user-friendly and responsive as well! Looking forward to hire them again to design my next upcoming site.</p>

    <p>These guys are absolutely the best in designing and development. I hired them for building my website from the scratch and told them all my requirements and preferences. They understood everything very easily and also recommended me some better alternatives wherever possible. They were helpful from the first interaction to the launch of our website through all the designing and development process. They ensured top quality, timely delivery and satisfactory support till the end of the project. I highly recommend them.</p>
